# SYSC5103_Software-Agents
SYSC5103 Assinment 1 - Question 2

Come up with a state-based soccer-playing agent. Ideally, the behaviour of the agent (i.e., the state machine) should again be stored in an editable text file separate from the code, but we're also ok with a hard-coded state machine as long as it is easy to modify it. Again, in a short guide (up to a page or two this time) tell us how to read, edit and make sense of your agent function definition, provide a human-readable finite state machine diagram (ideally in the extended UML FSM format discussed in class) corresponding to your implementation, describe how your code executes the agent definition, how to run your code, and what kind of behavior to expect when running your code. In addition, the guide should PROVE, using runs derived manually from the state machine or from logs obtained from running the agent, that the behaviour is indeed state-based and not reactive.
